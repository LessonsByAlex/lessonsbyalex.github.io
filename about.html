<p>Hello, my name is Alex, and I am a junior at Eastlake High School. I have been playing the violin for 7 years in chamber groups, large orchestras, and private lessons. I currently play in the first violin section of the audition only Eastlake Chamber Orchestra. My mentor is Hans Klein, who plays 1st violin in the Sammamish Symphony.<br>
<br>
​I teach beginner students from those who have never even held a violin to those who have several years of experience. I use the Essential Elements books when I teach. However, I also add in sheet music and other books depending on the needs and desires of the student.<br>
<br>
I am a calm, easygoing teacher, however I am very detail oriented when it comes to teaching the foundations of violin. I am comfortable teaching special needs students.<br>
<br>
I provide lessons in the front room of a large, pleasant suburban home in the north end of Sammamish. The room provides great acoustics and plenty of natural light.<br>
<br>
Note for those with allergies: there are 2 cats that live in the house. Our home is a non-smoking home.<br>
<br>
Parents are welcome to sit in and watch lessons. We have a comfortable seating area and a guest bathroom available for your use.​ Please do not bring other small children to the lesson, it makes it difficult for the student and teacher to focus.</p>
